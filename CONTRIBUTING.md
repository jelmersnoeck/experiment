# Contributing to Experiment

## Did you find a bug?

When [reporting bugs](https://github.com/jelmersnoeck/experiment/issues/new), try to be as thorough as possible:
- What version are you using?
- What are the steps to reproduce the issue?
- What is the expected behaviour?
- What is the actual behaviour?

When creating a new issue, a template will be injected where you can choose
wether it is a bug report, a feature request or a question.

## Did you write a patch?

Bug fixes and code improvements are always welcome (thanks for taking the time!).

New features are welcome as well, but they will be evaluated per case. A general
rule is to not generate external dependencies. If you'd rather not risk spending
time on a patch to possibly see it turned down later on, please start a
discussion by opening a [new issue](https://github.com/jelmersnoeck/experiment/issues/new) where you state this is a feature request.

Don't forget to add your changes to the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).
